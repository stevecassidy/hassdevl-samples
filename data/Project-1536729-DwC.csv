	Went to the Main Gaol to hear tidings of the State Prisoners, charged with Treason in taking up arms against the Government at Balaarat.  The Judge remanded them for 10 days, stating that being charged with High Treason, they were entitled to that term of clear notice with copies of their indictments from the opening of the Sessions. Mr Ireland the Counsel for the Defence, stated he was prepared to proceed at once, but the Chief Justice preferred granting the priviledge (sic) allowed by the Law.

	This conduct seems evidently to betray an inclination on the part of the Governt. to let the matter gradually drop, and in my opinion the men will not be tried at all.

	There is a great deal of excitement in the Town, and the Gaol Authorities fearing violence have barricaded and strengthened the Entrance, as well as made a door as close to the Court as possible by which to take the prisoners too (sic) and from Trial.  I remarked that people might break doors to get out, but that I hardly thought they would break them to get into the prison.

	The Visiting Magistrate inspected the Gaol today.  I wrote a letter to my sister at Geelong, enclosing one from our Father to her.",,

	Perrot came in and made an afternoon of it. Lent him five shillings to pay Hire of Buss (sic) for him to St Kilda.  Mr McNee called, had a Nobbler and called me mysteriously aside. Could I lend him five pounds, of course, Gave him the money.

	Joe's birthday so I went to St Kilda. Mr & Mrs Lotherington and the Misses Lotherington as also Perrot were there, had a pleasant evening but stayed rather late waiting for Perrot.  Met a Friend of Perrot's a short distance from the house and of course went home with him to have a Nobbler.  Perrot extremely anxious to stay all night, but I determined to sleep at home.  Got a little out of our latitude after passing across Richmond Paddock. I guided by Lights ahead steered for Melbourne, leaving Perrot declaring his ignorance of the Locality.

The Order of the Government now is that for every demand Two Householders shall sign their belief in its reasonableness.  Extremely hot all day.  Mr McNee called after office hours and paid me £8.1/ Eight Pounds One Shilling on account of John Martin at present under my charge.

Dined with Mr Black and knocked about till the Fancy Dress Ball commenced  Comparatively few people present and these of the Genus Fast. Drank with numbers but did not dance.  It is no use being a hypocrite with one's Diary,  I cannot dance and every day find it more and more a drawback. False Pride alone prevents me taking lessons.  I would not learn when a boy and now I have whiskers I am ashamed to be seen beginning.

John Edwards was dressed in character, or rather wore breeches silk stockings, flashed Doublet and hat bound with cherry ribbon, and auburn wig with curls a la Cavalier.

Drink, smoke and chaffs, kept me till the musicians were tired. I got home at four o clock A.M.

Improper persons will not be admitted to the Ball this Evening was an announcement extensively circulated, & to carry out the sanitory (sic) measure, a lynx eyed Detective was engaged to spot the naughty ones. Unfortunately he had but one eye, so the frail fair doubtless got on his blind side, for not a female was there in the room who was not notorious for selling her favors",,

Made up some newspapers for England & after four o clock, went out to Post them. On the road to the office met Messrs McNee & Newby, accompanied them of course to get a Nobbler.  Went to Coleman's great crowd there assembled to see a race for 75 Yards between a man and a horse.  All a humbug, and made up affair by the Publican.

Met Mr Haydn the Reporter of the Herald and our number thus increased walked on to the Cricket Ground where the Band of the 40th Regiment was playing.

On the way had a race with Newby, a pretty good match. I won.

I had Diarrhoea and thought it prudent to drink Brandy. Took a good deal to much  Dined with Newby at Richmond, and then went into town.  Pulled up at Coleman's by a Gaol acquaintance and set to work drinking.  Went into Gaol acquaintance’s house when Coleman shut up.  I shouted a couple of bottles of wine for which I threw down a soveriegn (sic).  Got very late and eventually was left with the Reporter & McNee. Wanted to stop with a woman that was in the house, she however was too mercenary, and though at last willing to come to my terms, my inclination for her had fled.

Great satisfaction however in waking in my own bed.

One of the hottest winds I ever experienced. Mr Matyr called to get out of the heat stopped with me till after Mr Stoddart had performed Divine Service and then invited me to dine at the Imperial. Had some very fair soup and tolerably cool porter.

Sea Breeze sprang up about half past two but died away very quickly, and left the evening intensely close.

Went to Church. Sat with Harrison. Saw William Lotherington and Perrot after the service, went to the Larder and had some bottled beer and then took a stroll with Harrison. The streets lined with people lounging about outside the open doors of their houses.

Harrison walked home with me, and sat till about half past ten.

Had to move noisy Lunatic from Ward to the Cell adjoining my Quarters, he most obstropolous for some time.

He being a bit of a Rogue made as much noise as he possibly could when he found I had some one with me.  Know of no means of treating such a lunatic excepting shrugging my shoulders and patience.

	We went to Black's Concert Room.  It was very hot and to me rather slow, fooled about and had a Nobbler or two and left, Mr Read inclined to be jolly, played two or three practical jokes and separated.  I went home and trust my late companions did the same.

	Dr Webster called during the day. I introduced him to an American Physician who had been sent me as insane.  This is a most extraordinary case.  Dr Wills is as intelligent and perfectly rational, a person, to converse with on any subject that I know.  He has however a belief or rather monomania that there is something wrong with his intellect.  This idea is really all that betrays any weakness of his mental powers.",,

I have spent tis true no more than my salary, but then of that salary I have wasted nearly the half.

The Presbyterian Minister addressed the Protestants.

Mr Stoddart Gaol chaplain paid us a visit.

Went down after muster and called on McEwen, he took me to see Lewis the Colonial Dispenser.  Mrs Lewis and her female companion are not all my style. Took Tea with Mrs McEwen and then she, I and Lewis went for ramble. Brought them home, had some Grog and left them eventually very talkative.

Mrs Lewis has a baby and that baby will she says be twelve months old to morrow.  So I am invited there to dine. It is really a great Bore, but as I escaped some [previous?] festivity by pleading indisposition I think I must go.

Women are deceitful wretches. When we called upon Mrs Lewis, We were told that Joseph would not kill the duck. It would not take him a moment to cut its throat says Mrs Lewis, or chop its head off with an axe sang her companion.  McEwen gallantly undertook the butchery, and when all was over and the duck suspended in the Larder, the women began to talk sentiment. What a pity it was to kill the poor thing.

The Technicalities of the Indictment in which the words of a flowery article were explained by the Quaint matter of fact of the Law caused much amusement in Court, to wit, “March on my people” by My People meaning the Diggers for Gold &c &c.

Mr Newby and Mr [Matyr?] accompanied me to Sandridge, to view the ruins caused by a large fire there yesterday evening. Nearly an acre of Ground yesterday thickly covered with habitations is now a heap of ruins. Was told a striking illustration of insignificance being security.

We went to Sandridge by Railway but returned by the Omnibus. Saw on returning that the Locomotive was off the Line. Great joy expressed by Passing lads and Turn Pike Man.

Went to the Promenade Concert in the Evening. Saw numbers I know but am very dissatisfied with myself for being tempted there so often. It costs a great deal of money, although the admission is but a shilling, for Australian [Politeness?] necessitates the asking of all speaking acquaintances to Nobblerise, and as Drinks cost each a shilling a Pound soon evaporates.

The Money however is not the principal cause of my disliking to be there. Tis the Publicity and the fear of being thought a fast fellow, for my temperament makes me conspicuous, as when with two or three companions, I generally become merry, talk loud and laugh noisily.
